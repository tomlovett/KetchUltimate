LATER, BRO:
alternating colors:
  colors = [primary, secondary]
  if (this.game !== above.game) { 
     this.color = (this.color + 1) % 2
  }

pushing a new rating:
	ratings.push(newRating)
	rating = ((ratings.length * rating) + newRating) / (ratings.length+1)
	// less computation


I want to have a workable team to mess with so I can visualize functionality, spot errors; generally, see a working app.

Working on ratings just to keep the energy going?

Otherwise, things are going pretty well. Chugging along, seems reasonable at the moment. Styling with Ionic should be pretty good.
