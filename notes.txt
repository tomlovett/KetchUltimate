how to have data persist between the views? one $scope object or some other method?
	through factories. objects and pointers. 
	$scope.team = globalData.team
	loading from server, assigning to globalData

database collections -> teams, players, player_ratings, rating_history

logging people in, confirming permissions in requests to server without compromising security

abstracting/isolating express API routing

passport through AJAX

navbar controller

Misc:
alternating colors:
  colors = [primary, secondary]
  if (this.game !== above.game) { 
     this.color = (this.color + 1) % 2
  }

pushing a new rating:
	ratings.push(newRating)
	rating = ((ratings.length * rating) + newRating) / (ratings.length+1)
	// less computation
