pretty good end result considering the ass whooping I took this morning. ionic structure makes sense, ionic snippets make sense. there is functionality, it works. there is plenty more to do, especially with game and navbars, but the basics kinda work.  you toughed it out pretty damn well today. take a deep breath, let yourself rest and do tomorrow's work tomorrow. avoid repeating the overwhelming by chopping it up, focusing on the next thing. godspeed.
